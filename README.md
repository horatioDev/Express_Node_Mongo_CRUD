# Building a Simple CRUD app with Node, Express, and MongoDB

## Overview
This tutorial will guide you through building a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. If you're new to server-side programming, don't worry! We'll explain each component as we go along.

### Technologies Used
- Node.js
- Express.js
- MongoDB

## Introduction to CRUD, Express, and MongoDB
Before diving into the tutorial, let's briefly introduce the key components:

- **Express**: A framework for building web applications on top of Node.js. It simplifies the server creation process and allows you to use JavaScript as your server-side language.
- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database used to store information for your applications.
- **CRUD**: Stands for Create, Read, Update, and Delete, representing the basic operations that can be performed on data. In the context of web development, these operations correspond to HTTP methods like POST, GET, PUT, and DELETE.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Basic command-line knowledge
- Node.js installed on your system

### Setting Up Your Project
1. Create a new folder for your project.
2. Navigate to the project folder in your terminal.
3. Initialize a new Node.js project by running `npm init`.
4. Install Express by running `npm install express`.
5. Create a file named `server.js` and add a simple Express server setup.

## CRUD Operations with Express and MongoDB
### 1. CRUD - READ (GET)
- Handle GET requests to retrieve data.
- Use Express to define routes and handle requests.
- Send data back to the client for display.

### 2. CRUD - CREATE (POST)
- Handle POST requests to create new data entries.
- Use HTML forms or JavaScript to send data to the server.
- Parse incoming data and store it in the MongoDB database.

### 3. CRUD - UPDATE (PUT)
- Handle PUT requests to update existing data.
- Send updates to the server using JavaScript or forms.
- Modify existing data in the MongoDB database.

### 4. CRUD - DELETE (DELETE)
- Handle DELETE requests to remove data.
- Send delete requests from the client to the server.
- Remove data from the MongoDB database.

## Conclusion
Congratulations! You've learned how to build a simple CRUD application using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. This tutorial covered the basics of server-side programming and database interactions. Feel free to explore more advanced topics and customize your application further.
